This is my second Boot.dev project! It is a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) modules.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10+ installed
- uv project and package manager (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
- If you are on WSL, you will probably also need to install VcXsrv (https://vcxsrv.com/)

**To play:**
1. Download the files
2. Using the shell in the folder location, enter `uv run main.py`

**Controls**
- W - Up
- A - Left
- S - Down
- D - Right
- Space - Shoot
